# Cookie-Clicker-Game

This is my Week 3 Assignment - a Cookie Clicker Game!

Required üéØ What requirements did you achieve? üéØ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve? üéØ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks? Optional üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

- I was able to make a cookie button that incrementaly when up in one value

- I was able to retreved information from the API provided. However i was not able to display that infromation onto the DOM/HTML ... although I tried i was only able to display the names and costs of the objecst within the array provided by the API. I wanted to display the data from the API in a table format and i was unable to do so. Instead I manually did a table on the html showing 5/10 upgrades provided by the API. I did not even attempt or think about wrangling any data. Therefore I will likely need further assitance on that.

- I was unable to able to do interactive buy buttons so that the user could purchase upgrades....I think im usualy okay with elementbyIDs and event listeners but what through me off was making my cookie count go up in a certain amount e.g by 5 or by 10 etc

- I tried but did not store game infromation into local storage

- I do not understand setInterval outside of timers and i couldnt display a value that managed the game every second.

- I gained help from online sources mainly to do the table (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjaRIM4Bjs)
  and to make a valu go up incremently by 1 at the click of a button (SheCodes) etc.

I have been struggling with grapsing a lot of concepts thus far unfortunately. I am comfortable to say that I am not enjoying this process YET!
The teaching is WONDERFUL. The concepts are difficult to recall and apply to a real life website.

Its just that everything i have learnt in the past has made logical sense to me....coding doesnt not make sense to me at the moment ...there are too many variables and there are too many different ways of doing the same technical thing.

I hope to improve throughout the course. Manny's words the other day was promising.
